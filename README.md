# Zindi-UmojaHack-South-Africa-Yassir-ETA-Prediction-Challenge
1 day Zindi Hackathon competition - CatBoost Regression model

The UmojaHack South Africa: Yassir ETA Prediction Challenge by UmojaHack Africa was hosted on the 25th of July 2020 and had a 9 hours constraint. I entered as an individual and my model ranked 13 out of 119.

Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Yassir rely on real-time data and machine learning algorithms to automate their services. Accurately predicting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for Yassir trips will make Yassirâ€™s services more reliable and attractive; this will have a direct and indirect impact on both customers and business partners. The solution would help the company save money and allocate more resources to other parts of the business.

The objective of this hackathon was to predict the estimated time of arrival at the dropoff point for a single Yassir journey.
